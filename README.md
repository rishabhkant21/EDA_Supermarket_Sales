# Supermarket Sales Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a supermarket sales dataset to uncover key insights into sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance. By analyzing transaction data from multiple supermarket branches, this project aims to help retail businesses optimize inventory management, marketing strategies, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement
Retailers often face challenges in understanding their sales data effectively, which can hinder decision-making and business growth. This analysis addresses these challenges by providing detailed insights into sales trends, customer demographics, and purchasing habits through visualizations and statistical summaries.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains sales transaction records with the following key features:
- Invoice ID, Branch, City
- Customer type, Gender
- Product line, Unit price, Quantity
- Tax, Total, Cost of goods sold (cogs)
- Gross margin percentage, Gross income
- Transaction Date and Time
- Payment method
- Customer Rating

## Key Analysis Steps
- Data cleaning: Handling missing values and duplicates
- Data transformation: Parsing dates and setting index
- Univariate analysis: Distribution of customer ratings and sales quantities
- Bivariate and multivariate analysis: Relationships between gross income, ratings, branches, and gender
- Time series analysis of gross income trends
- Automated profiling with ydata_profiling to summarize dataset characteristics

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- pandas, numpy for data manipulation
- seaborn, matplotlib for visualization
- ydata_profiling for automated report generation
- Jupyter Notebook for an interactive coding environment

## Results
The notebook includes detailed visualizations such as distribution plots, boxplots, regression plots, and time series line charts. It also generates a comprehensive profiling report for further exploration of the data.
